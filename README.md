# challenge1-horiseon-refactored
U of T Bootacamp Weekly Challenge 1: HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

The existing Horiseon application was updated with the following improvements:

- Improve accessibility by using semantic elements, image alt attributes and update to the page's title element
- The stylesheet and HTML was also simplified and commented for easier reading
- A link in the menu was updated to ensure that all menu links are working
- The exterior appearance of the app remains unchanged. All of the improvements were done "under the hood"
